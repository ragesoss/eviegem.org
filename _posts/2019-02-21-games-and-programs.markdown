My brother Brighton has a new program. it is fun. [He has a game](https://github.com/brightonmaxwellross/dice.rb/blob/master/dice.rb)! [I do too](https://github.com/ragesoss/eviegem.org/blob/master/ruby/zelda.rb). We are both happy.
We both have games. We like our games. I hope you play them and like them too. My brother Brighton is writing about magic the gathering.
I play it. it is fun. I hope you like it too. My dad plays keyforge.
